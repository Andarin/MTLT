4 tables included:

1) df.amniota.spec:
Table of real data obtained from Ensembl 78, formatted to create the plot.
a) species: names of 21 well-assembled Amniota species in Ensembl 78
b) chrom_cum: for each species, as many equi-distant values between 0 and 1 as species has chromosomes according to Ensembl 78
c) gene_cum: relative gene amount according to Ensembl 78

2) df.amniota.est:
Table of inferred data, based on Ensembl 78 data and the inference software ChromEvol 2.
3 variables:
a) species: always "amniota"
b) chrom_cum: 21 equi-distant values between 0 and 1; representing 21 chromosomes of amniota, based on estimation via ChromEvol 2
c) gene_cum: relative gene amount; average of all 20 well-assembled Amniota species in Ensembl 78

3) df.sim.amniota:
Equivalent to df.aminota.spec, with the difference that these genomes are not real, but simulated with the simulation software MagSimus.
a) species: names of 5 Amniota species simulated with MagSimus
b) chrom_cum: for each species, as many equi-distant values between 0 and 1 as species has chromosomes in the MagSimus simulation
c) gene_cum: simulated relative gene amount

4) df.dist:
Simulated data, showing limit distribution of two different chromosome selection mechanisms.
3 variables:
a) species: either "Proportional" or "Uniform"
b) chrom_cum: 100 equi-distant values between 0 and 1 for both mechanisms ("species")
c) gene_cum: simulated relative gene amount
