Folder of chromosome-ise genome-genome comparisons. For each genome-pair, there are 3 csv. They display the number of homologeous genes for each chromosome-chromosome pairing, according to different measurement methods.
"AllDup" counts all homologies, and therefore counts duplicated genes multiple times.
"NoDup" ignores all genes which appear multiple times in at least one of both genomes in the comparison.
"Prob" counts duplicated genes proportional to their number, i.e. if there are 4 duplicates, each counts for 0.25 genes.
