2 tables included:

df.aic:
Data calculated with ChromEvol 2 software. Database of >500 chromosome sizes for different genomes was a combination of the genomesize.com database and Ensembl 78. The phylogenetic times came from timetree.com
variables:
a) GainRate: Imposed rate of chromosome gains per million years
b) LossRate: Imposed rate of chromosome losses per million years
c) LogLikelihood: LogLikelihood of the whole model as calculated by ChromEvol 2
d) AIC: AIC of the whole model as calculated by ChromEvol 2
e) AmniotaChr: optimal Amniota chromosome number as implied by the model
f) AmniotaChrLikeli: optimal Likelihood of the Amniota chromosome number as implied by the model (in comparison to 1, 2, 3, ... chromosomes)
g) rect.min: inferred minimal gain/loss-rate with equal Amniota chromosome number (linear interpolation based on a) and d) )
h) rect.max: inferred maximal gain/loss-rate with equal Amniota chromosome number (linear interpolation based on a) and d) )

df.rect:
Rectangle information extracted from df.aic. This was done due to the fact that plotting several rectangles with the same colors side by side lead to an unaesthetic 1 pixel column between them. Therefore, same coloured rectangles were grouped together.
variables:
a) AmniotaChr: optimal Amniota chromosome number as implied by the model
b) rect.min: inferred minimal gain/loss-rate with equal Amniota chromosome number
c) rect.max: inferred maximal gain/loss-rate with equal Amniota chromosome number
